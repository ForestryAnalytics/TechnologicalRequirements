#### Implementation

R, RStudio, and sparklyr can be added to the YARN managed cluster. 

The highlights are:
*    R, RStudio, and sparklyr need to be installed on one node only, typically an edge node
*    The Data Scientist can access R, Spark, and the cluster via a web browser by navigating to the RStudio IDE inside the edge node
