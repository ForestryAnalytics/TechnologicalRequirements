#### Performance Comparison 

Spark: Spark has been found to run 100 times faster in-memory, and 10 times faster on disk. It's also been used to sort 100 TB of data 3 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce on one-tenth of the machines. Spark has particularly been found to be faster on machine learning applications, such as Naive Bayes and k-means.(https://logz.io/blog/hadoop-vs-spark/).
