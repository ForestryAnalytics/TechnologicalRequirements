##  Apache Arrow

* Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. 
* Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.


Arrow itself is not a storage or execution engine. It is designed to serve as a shared foundation for the following types of systems:

* SQL execution engines (e.g., Drill and Impala)
* Data analysis systems (e.g., Pandas and Spark)
* Streaming and queueing systems (e.g., Kafka and Storm)
* Storage systems (e.g., Parquet, Kudu, Cassandra and HBase)
