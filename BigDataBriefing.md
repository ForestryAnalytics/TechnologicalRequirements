### What is a Graph Database?

Very simply, a graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. It is intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model. Instead, the data is stored like we first draw it out - showing how each individual entity connects with or is related to others.
