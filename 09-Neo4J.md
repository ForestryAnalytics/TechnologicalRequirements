## Neo4J
Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications. Initial development began in 2003, but it has been publicly available since 2007. The source code, written in Java and Scala, is available for free on GitHub or as a user-friendly desktop application download

#### Use Case

* "Transforming Logistics: Real-time Routing and Tracking with Neo4j"

“A logistics network is a graph, and doesn’t fit the table structure of a relational database well,” says Wagenknecht. The team chose Neo4j for its flexibility and scalability. With Neo4j’s native graph storage and processing engine, transactions took milliseconds, not minutes, for high-speed, full graph, database traversals.
