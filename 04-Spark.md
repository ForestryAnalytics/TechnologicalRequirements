## Spark

Apache Spark™ is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

#### Introduction

* Apache Spark is a lightning-fast cluster computing technology, designed for fast computation, and fast, in-memory data processing. 
* It is based on Hadoop MapReduce and it extends the MapReduce model to efficiently use it for more types of computations, which includes interactive queries and stream processing. 
* The main feature of Spark is its in-memory cluster computing that increases the processing speed of an application.
* Spark is designed to cover a wide range of workloads such as batch applications, iterative algorithms, interactive queries and streaming. 
* Apart from supporting all these workload in a respective system, it reduces the management burden of maintaining separate tools.
* Spark has an expressive development APIs to allow data workers to efficiently execute streaming, machine learning or SQL workloads that require fast iterative access to datasets. 
* With Spark running on Apache Hadoop YARN, developers everywhere can now create applications to exploit Spark’s power, derive insights, and enrich their data science workloads within a single, shared dataset in Hadoop.

#### Deployment

* Spark runs on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources.

* Spark can be operated using its standalone cluster mode, on EC2, on Hadoop YARN, on Mesos, or on Kubernetes. Access data in HDFS, Alluxio, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, and hundreds of other data sources. 

* Spark can closely integrate with Hadoop and Hive, the ability to cache data into memory across multiple nodes, data transformers, and its Machine Learning libraries.
